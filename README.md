The gamiong room is a client that wanted to expand their android game into a web-based platform that is cross-platformed. They needed a flexible scalable system that would work to support mulitple player and platforms.
I outlined the operating platforms storage memory management security and how the game could scale across devices.
Creating a design document helped organize the systems structure ahead of time making it easier to plan coding tasks and avoid issues. 
I would revise the distributed systems section by providing more technical detail. 
I focused on scalability security and multidevice compatibility because the client wanted the game to grow and run across platforms. Considering user needs is crucial because it insures the final product is functional reliable and meets their goals.
